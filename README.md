## Description
Data structures
This project focuses on implementing various operations and algorithms related to binary trees in the C programming language. The tasks include understanding the concepts of binary trees, tree traversal methods, and characteristics of different types of binary trees.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

- What is a binary tree?
- The difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree.
- The possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists.
- Definitions of depth, height, and size of a binary tree.
- Different traversal methods to go through a binary tree.
- Characteristics of complete, full, perfect, and balanced binary trees.

## Requirements

- **Allowed editors**: vi, vim, emacs
- **Compilation**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- **File Endings**: All files should end with a new line
- **Coding Style**: Usage of Betty style for coding style, checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- **Global Variables**: No global variables allowed
- **Functions per File**: Maximum 5 functions per file
- **Standard Library**: Usage of standard library is allowed
- **Header File**: Prototypes of all functions should be included in header file `binary_trees.h`
- **Include Guards**: All header files should be include guarded

## Project Structure

- `binary_trees.h`: Header file containing prototypes of all functions.
- `0-binary_tree_node.c`: Function to create a new binary tree node.
- `1-binary_tree_insert_left.c`: Function to insert a node as the left child of another node.
- `2-binary_tree_insert_right.c`: Function to insert a node as the right child of another node.
- ...
- `README.md`: This file, containing project description, requirements, and structure.

## Usage

To use the functions implemented in this project, include the `binary_trees.h` header file in your C files and compile with the provided flags. For example:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 main.c 0-binary_tree_node.c -o binary_tree
./binary_tree
```
